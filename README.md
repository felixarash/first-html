# First HTML Assignment — Nostalgia, Space, and Love

This site began as my first school assignment in HTML. I kept the original content and spirit, and later made small improvements for discoverability and clarity: basic SEO meta tags, Open Graph/Twitter cards, a JSON-LD schema, a sitemap, a robots file, and light code alignment cleanup. Everything else remains true to the original assignment — a nostalgic snapshot of how I love space, altruism, and love.

## What Stayed Original
- Core text, images, audio, and video content
- Layout and intent of the page
- The personal, reflective tone about love and space

## What I Tweaked
- Added SEO tags (meta description, keywords, canonical)
- Added Open Graph and Twitter card tags
- Added JSON-LD for `WebSite`, `Person`, and `ImageObject`
- Added `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
- Cleaned minor alignment/semantics without changing the story

## Nostalgia
Space taught me wonder. Love taught me kindness. Altruism taught me to care beyond myself. This page is a memory of learning, curiosity, and the optimism that simple HTML can carry a big feeling.
